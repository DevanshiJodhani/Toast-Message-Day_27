# 💌 Toast Message
I completed this Day 27 challenge in #30DaysOfHtmlCSS.


## Description

A toast message is a non-intrusive, temporary notification that appears on a user's screen, typically at the bottom or top, conveying important information or updates. It is commonly used in web and mobile applications to provide quick feedback, alerts, or confirmation messages without interrupting the user's workflow. Toast messages usually have a short lifespan, automatically disappearing after a few seconds. They offer a clean and unobtrusive way to communicate essential information to users and improve the overall user experience.

## Example :-

When you copy a message or a link, the message appears on the desktop or mobile screen for two-three seconds and then the message disappears, this is called a toast message.
